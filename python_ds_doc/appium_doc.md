It is designed for reference, sharing, and interview preparation, with a focus on Android automation.
1. Appium Architecture Overview
Appium is an open-source, cross-platform automation framework for testing mobile applications (native, hybrid, mobile web) on Android, iOS, and other platforms. It leverages the WebDriver protocol, enabling language-agnostic test scripts and extensibility.
Key Components

Appium Client:
Libraries (e.g., Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript) for writing test scripts.
Communicates with the Appium server using HTTP requests (W3C WebDriver Protocol in Appium 2.0, JSON Wire Protocol in Appium 1.x).


Appium Server:
Node.js-based server exposing a REST API.
Manages test sessions and routes commands to platform-specific drivers.


Platform-Specific Drivers:
Android: UIAutomator2 (default for API 16+), Espresso, Selendroid (older APIs).
iOS: XCUITest (iOS 9.3+).
Translates WebDriver commands into platform-specific instructions.


Bootstrap Layer:
Device-side component executing commands.
Android: bootstrap.jar uses UIAutomator2.
iOS: bootstrap.js uses XCUITest.


End Device:
Physical device, emulator, or simulator running the app under test (AUT).
Communicates via platform tools (e.g., ADB for Android, Xcode for iOS).



How Appium Works

Test script sends Desired Capabilities (e.g., platformName, deviceName, app) to initialize a session.
Appium server routes commands to the appropriate driver.
Driver translates commands into platform-specific actions via the Bootstrap Layer.
Device executes actions, and results are returned through the same chain.

2. Appium 2.0: Changes and Advantages

5. Roles of UIAutomator2, Appium UIAutomator2 Server, and Bootstrap Layer
Inbuilt UIAutomator2

Role: Google’s native Android testing framework (part of Android SDK).
Functions:
Provides APIs (e.g., UiDevice, UiObject2) for UI automation.
Interacts with Android’s accessibility framework for element identification and actions.
Supports cross-app and system UI automation (e.g., Settings, notifications).


Significance:
Native, reliable UI interaction at the system level.
Faster and more stable than UIAutomator, supports modern Android APIs.



Appium UIAutomator2 Server

Role: Android app (appium-uiautomator2-server.apk) installed on the device, acting as an on-device server.
Functions:
Receives commands from the UIAutomator2 driver via ADB.
Delegates commands to the Bootstrap Layer.
Manages session context and returns responses.


Significance:
Provides a device-side interface for command processing.
Ensures reliable communication between off-device driver and on-device automation.



Bootstrap Layer (bootstrap.jar)

Role: Java-based component within the Appium UIAutomator2 Server, translating commands into UIAutomator2 API calls.
Functions:
Executes UI actions (e.g., click, swipe).
Retrieves UI hierarchy for element identification.
Communicates with the Appium UIAutomator2 Server via a socket.


Significance:
Bridges WebDriver commands to native UIAutomator2 APIs.
Runs in the device’s runtime environment for precise execution.



Why ADB Alone is Insufficient

ADB: Handles low-level tasks (e.g., port forwarding, APK installation) but lacks UI automation capabilities.
UIAutomator2: Provides high-level APIs for element interaction, executed via the Appium UIAutomator2 Server and Bootstrap Layer.

6. Elaborative Interaction Flow: findElement and click
Example Test Code
import io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver;
import io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidDriver;
import io.appium.java_client.remote.MobileCapabilityType;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import java.net.URL;

public class AppiumTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();
        caps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, "Android");
        caps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, "emulator-5554");
        caps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.APP, "/path/to/app.apk");
        caps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.AUTOMATION_NAME, "UiAutomator2");

        AppiumDriver driver = new AndroidDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4723/wd/hub"), caps);

        // Find and click an element
        driver.findElement(By.id("com.example:id/button")).click();
    }
}

Detailed Interaction Flow
The command driver.findElement(By.id("com.example:id/button")).click() triggers a multi-step process across Appium’s components. Below is an elaborative breakdown:
Step 1: Test Code (Appium Client)

Action:
The client library constructs two HTTP requests using the W3C WebDriver Protocol:
Find Element:POST /session/:sessionId/element
{
  "using": "id",
  "value": "com.example:id/button"
}


Click Element (after receiving element reference):POST /session/:sessionId/element/:elementId/click
{}






Details:
The By.id("com.example:id/button") specifies the element’s resource-id, a unique identifier in Android.
The client sends requests to the Appium server at http://localhost:4723/wd/hub.
The :sessionId identifies the active test session, initialized via Desired Capabilities.


Output: HTTP requests sent to the Appium server.

Step 2: Appium Server

Action:
Receives HTTP requests and parses the session ID to identify the test context.
Routes the commands to the UIAutomator2 driver, based on the automationName: UiAutomator2 capability.
Maintains session state (e.g., device, app, driver details).


Details:
Acts as a central hub, ensuring commands are processed in the correct order.
Validates the W3C-compliant JSON payload and forwards it to the driver.


Output: Commands forwarded to the UIAutomator2 driver.

Step 3: UIAutomator2 Driver

Action:
The UIAutomator2 driver (@appium/uiautomator2-driver, a Node.js package) translates WebDriver commands into Android-specific instructions.
For findElement:
Converts By.id("com.example:id/button") to a UIAutomator2 selector: new UiSelector().resourceId("com.example:id/button").
Sends an HTTP request to the Appium UIAutomator2 Server on the device.


For click:
Uses the element reference (e.g., element-123) to send a click command.


Establishes communication with the device via ADB.


Details:
Manages device connection details (e.g., port forwarding).
Formats commands for compatibility with the Appium UIAutomator2 Server.


Output: Commands sent to the Appium UIAutomator2 Server via ADB.

Step 4: ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

Action:
Facilitates communication between the UIAutomator2 driver and the Appium UIAutomator2 Server on the device.
Session Initialization (performed earlier):
Installs two APKs:
appium-uiautomator2-server.apk: The Appium UIAutomator2 Server.
appium-uiautomator2-server-test.apk: A test app for UIAutomator2.

adb install appium-uiautomator2-server.apk


Forwards a TCP port for socket communication:adb forward tcp:6790 tcp:6790




For findElement and click:
Relays HTTP requests from the UIAutomator2 driver to the Appium UIAutomator2 Server.
May execute auxiliary commands (e.g., UI hierarchy dump):adb shell uiautomator dump /sdcard/window_dump.xml
adb pull /sdcard/window_dump.xml






Details:
Acts as a transport layer, not a UI automation tool.
Ensures reliable socket communication between off-device and on-device components.


Output: Commands delivered to the Appium UIAutomator2 Server.

Step 5: Appium UIAutomator2 Server

Action:
The Appium UIAutomator2 Server (appium-uiautomator2-server.apk) runs as a process on the Android device/emulator.
Receives HTTP requests from the UIAutomator2 driver via the ADB socket (port 6790).
For findElement:
Delegates the command to locate resource-id: com.example:id/button to the Bootstrap Layer.


For click:
Delegates the click command for the element reference to the Bootstrap Layer.


Manages session context on the device.


Details:
Acts as an on-device server, processing WebDriver commands.
Encapsulates the Bootstrap Layer, ensuring commands are executed in the correct app context.
Returns responses (e.g., element reference, action status) to the UIAutomator2 driver.


Output: Commands forwarded to the Bootstrap Layer.

Step 6: Bootstrap Layer (bootstrap.jar)

Action:
The Bootstrap Layer (embedded as bootstrap.jar within the Appium UIAutomator2 Server) translates commands into native UIAutomator2 API calls.
For findElement:
Uses UIAutomator2’s API to query the UI hierarchy:UiObject2 element = UiDevice.getInstance(InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation())
                           .findObject(By.res("com.example", "button"));


Retrieves the UI hierarchy (similar to uiautomator dump) to locate the element.
Returns a unique element reference (e.g., element-123).


For click:
Executes the click action on the element:element.click();


Simulates a tap at the element’s coordinates.




Details:
Runs within the Appium UIAutomator2 Server’s process.
Interacts directly with the inbuilt UIAutomator2 framework.
Parses UI hierarchy XML to identify element properties (e.g., bounds, text).


Output: Commands executed, results sent to the Appium UIAutomator2 Server.

Step 7: Inbuilt UIAutomator2

Action:
The inbuilt UIAutomator2, part of the Android SDK, performs the actual UI interactions.
For findElement:
Queries the Android accessibility framework to locate the element with resource-id: com.example:id/button.
Returns the element’s properties (e.g., coordinates, ID) to the Bootstrap Layer.


For click:
Simulates a tap on the element’s coordinates using system-level APIs.
Ensures the action mimics a real user interaction.




Details:
Operates at the system level, accessing app and system UI elements.
Provides robust APIs for element identification (e.g., By.res, By.text) and actions (e.g., click, swipe).
Returns execution results (e.g., success/failure) to the Bootstrap Layer.


Output: UI action performed, result returned to the Bootstrap Layer.

Step 8: Response Flow

Inbuilt UIAutomator2: Returns results (e.g., element reference for findElement, success for click) to the Bootstrap Layer.
Bootstrap Layer: Sends results to the Appium UIAutomator2 Server.
Appium UIAutomator2 Server: Relays results to the UIAutomator2 driver via ADB.
ADB: Transports responses back to the UIAutomator2 driver.
UIAutomator2 Driver: Formats responses as W3C-compliant JSON:
For findElement:{
  "value": {
    "ELEMENT": "element-123"
  }
}


For click:{
  "value": null
}




Appium Server: Returns responses to the client.
Test Code: Receives the element reference and proceeds with the click command or further steps.

7. Command Mapping to ADB/UIAutomator2



Appium Command
UIAutomator2 Operation
ADB Equivalent (if applicable)



findElement(By.id("id"))
UiDevice.findObject(By.res("id"))
adb shell uiautomator dump


element.click()
UiObject2.click()
adb shell input tap x y


element.sendKeys("text")
UiObject2.setText("text")
adb shell input text "text"


performTouchAction(swipe)
UiDevice.swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2, steps)
adb shell input swipe x1 y1 x2 y2


element.getAttribute("text")
UiObject2.getText()
adb shell uiautomator dump


Note: ADB commands are limited and less reliable; UIAutomator2 ensures precise UI automation.
